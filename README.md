# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that predicts whether a breast tumor is **Benign** or **Malignant** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. This project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.
